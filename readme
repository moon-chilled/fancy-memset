hopefully fast memset implementation
numbers depend heavily on sizes, but:
20-150% faster than freebsd memset
300-500% faster than rep stos on erms systems, for sizes smaller than 0.5-1k (for sizes larger than that, it uses rep stos)
500-1700% faster than openbsd memset
5-90% faster than bionic memset, except for extremely small sizes (this is not really a fair comparison since the compiler will inline small constant memsets, and small nonconstant memsets don't need to be very fast)
30% slower than glibc

try it out on your system: 'make'
if you have an amd cpu or an older intel cpu: 'make erms='
